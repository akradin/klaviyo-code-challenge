<!-- A couple of things to note, I was not sure how to test to see if data was
pushed to Klaviyo or not since it seemed like, based off of the docs, you need to
add the script to the Shopify code which I don't have access to

I was also able to come up with two curl requests which will be available in this
repo that I think are supposed to be used in some instance however that would mean
the script would need to be an AJAX request so that didn't really make sense to me -->
